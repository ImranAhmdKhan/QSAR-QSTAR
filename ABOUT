# Comprehensive Statistical Analysis and QSAR Modeling App in R Shiny
#
# This application provides a full suite of tools for data analysis, including:
# 1. Data loading and exploration with automated guidance based on dataset size.
# 2. Data preprocessing (imputation, transformation).
# 3. Descriptive statistics and correlation analysis.
# 4. Dimensionality reduction (PCA) and clustering (K-Means, Hierarchical).
# 5. Automated feature selection for Multiple Linear Regression (MLR).
# 6. Hyperparameter tuning for advanced models.
# 7. A publication-focused analysis module with advanced diagnostics and reporting.
# 8. A dedicated module for XGBoost (Extreme Gradient Boosting).
# 9. Advanced validation including Applicability Domain (Williams Plot) and Y-Scrambling.
# 10. A consolidated Analysis Dashboard for viewing all key plots together.
# 11. Automated report generation.
#
# --- V16 ENHANCEMENTS ---
# - Upgraded PCA plots to a more professional, publication-ready style based on user example.
# - Improvised the Scree Plot to be more informative, showing both individual and
#   cumulative variance explained using ggplot2.
# - Added centered axes and a fixed aspect ratio to the PCA Scores Plot.
# - Complete UI overhaul for a more professional and modern interface.
